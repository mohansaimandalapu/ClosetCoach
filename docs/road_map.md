# ClosetCoach Roadmap

ClosetCoach roadmap is where you can learn about what features we're working on, what stage they're in, and when we expect to bring them to you. Have any questions or comments about items on the roadmap? Share your feedback via [ClosetCoach public feedback discussions](https://github.com/satishjasthi/ClosetCoach/discussions).

The roadmap is arranged on a [project board](https://github.com/users/satishjasthi/projects/2) to give a sense of how far out each item is on the horizon. Every feature is added to a particular project board column according to the priority and the timeline in which it is expected to ship next.
