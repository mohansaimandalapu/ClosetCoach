<h2 id="closetcoach-features">ClosetCoach Features</h2>
<p>We've designed ClosetCoach with features that cater to your every
fashion need. Here's a closer look at what we offer:</p>

advanced algorithm can analyze your attire picture and tag it with all
the product and meta attributes, so you don't have to. Our feature can
recognize product super categories like TopWear, BottomWear, FootWear,
Sports Wear, Accessories, SleepWear, and Ethnic and FestiveWear. We also
recognize specific product categories like T-shirts, Shirts, Jeans,
Casual Trousers, Formal Trousers, Shorts, and Track Pants &amp; many
more.Additionally, we provide product metadata, including color
information, product style, print type, and much more, so you have a
complete understanding of your clothes.</p>
<h3 id="digital-wardrobe-creation">Digital Wardrobe Creation</h3>
<p>No more digging through piles of clothes in your closet! Our digital
wardrobe creation feature enables you to upload pictures of your clothes
and create a virtual wardrobe. Now you can access all your clothes in
one place and easily plan your outfits for the week.</p>

<h2 id="project-structure">Project Structure</h2>
<p>Firstly, let me explain that this project is split into two main parts
-Codebase - Documentation plus Tutorials.</p>
<p>The Codebase is where you'll find all the actual project files,
including the source code, which is located in the <strong>ClosetCoach</strong>
folder under the project root directory. This is where the real magic
happens, where all the coding and development work takes place to bring
the project to life.</p>
<p>The second part of the project is the Documentation plus Tutorials. This
is where we'll be providing helpful guides, tips and tutorials on how a
particular feature of the project was developed and how to use it .
Every alternate week, we'll be updating this section with new
information on how specific features were implemented, as well as
tutorials on how to use them. You can find this section in the <strong>docs</strong>
folder located in the project root directory.</p>
<p>We believe that having a strong Documentation plus Tutorials section is
just as important as having a well-functioning Codebase. This is because
it's the place where users can learn how to implement features of
ClosetCoach using Deep learning based Computer Vision skills and find
helpful information on how to use the project to its full potential. We
understand that sometimes technical jargon can be intimidating, which is
why we're committed to making our documentation as user-friendly and
engaging as possible.</p>
<h2 id="project-roadmap">Project Roadmap</h2>
<p>Are you curious about what features ClosetCoach has in store for you in
the coming weeks and months? Look no further than our roadmap! Our
roadmap provides you with an overview of the features we are currently
working on, what stage they are in, and when we expect to release them.</p>
<p>We welcome feedback from our users through our <a href="https://github.com/satishjasthi/ClosetCoach/discussions">public discussion
forums</a>, as we
believe in the power of collaboration and the open source community.</p>
<p>Our <a href="https://github.com/users/satishjasthi/projects/2">project board</a> is
organized by priority and timeline, making it easy for you to follow our
progress and stay up-to-date on the latest developments.We are committed
to providing the best possible experience for our users and believe that
the open source nature of our project will allow for continued growth
and improvement.</p>
<p>Join us on our journey to improve computer vision skills and create a
thriving open source community!</p>
<h2 id="contribution-guidelines">Contribution guidelines</h2>
<h3 id="issues">Issues</h3>
<p>We use Github issues to track public bugs and feature updates or
enhancements and <a href="https://github.com/satishjasthi/ClosetCoach/discussions">public discussion
forums</a> for any
questions or feedback issues. Please make sure to follow one of the
issue templates when reporting any issues.</p>
<h3 id="pull-requests">Pull Requests</h3>
<p>We actively welcome pull requests.</p>
<p>However, if you're adding any significant features (e.g.Â > 50 lines),
please make sure to discuss with maintainers about your motivation and
proposals in an issue before sending a PR. This is to save your time so
you don't spend time on a PR that we'll not accept.</p>
